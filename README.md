## Installation

You can install everything [the usual Python
way](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/). It
should be as simple as running the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/rtts/databosch
    cd databosch
    python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/databosch
    source ~/.virtualenvs>/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Alright, it should actually even be simpler:

    pip3 install https://github.com/rtts/databosch

But doing it that way won't install the specific dependencies listed
in `requirements.txt`. So I recommend the first way :-)

After installation, you can use the various [Django management
commands](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/) to
setup a database and run a development server.
